fake news detection using machine learning
Aim:
To develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model that can detect fake news
articles by analyzing text content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques,
helping to mitigate misinformation and ensure the credibility of online information.
Objective:
• To collect and preprocess a dataset containing both real and fake news articles from
sources like Kaggle, news websites, and fact-checking organizations.
• To apply text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal,
stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT
embeddings).
• To train various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, Naïve Bayes, and deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers.
• To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• To optimize the best-performing model through hyperparameter tuning and feature
selection.
• To deploy the trained model in a web-based or desktop application that allows users
to input news articles and receive real-time classification results.
